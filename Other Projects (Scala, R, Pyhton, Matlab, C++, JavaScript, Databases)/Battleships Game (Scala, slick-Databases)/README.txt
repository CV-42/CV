# Battleships-myname

A friend proposed to me to teach me Scala.
So he set up a git repo, and I started to code a program which plays the battleship game.
But then Covid started, and we did not continue... :(

I found these files in an old Bitbucket archive. I hope, that it still runs, because I did not reinstall Scala.

The runable class is
	\src\main\scala\de\myname\battleships\Test.scala
Which lets two "random AIs" play against each other.

The program shows applications of GUIs, Databases, Pattern Matching, object oriented programming style, and hopefully good functional programming style. ^^

Here, we consider a bilayer lce plate, clamped, and deforming just along two dimensions, and the director is tangentially confined.
This is quite a useful regime.

The algorithm is based on the algorithm given by my collaborators.
The FEM-matrices are getting assembled "by hand" (without dune, fenics, openfem, ...)

Task: Classify automotive sensor data to "broken damper" or "not broken damper"

Unfortunately, the data was given to us by a company, and we had to delete this data.

The classification went quite vell (see "Zusatzaufgabe Auswertung.odt").
But attempts to improve the result by using other neural network topologies did not work.

It is "Image"-classification because the timeline data is converted to pictures  by using a Fourier transform.

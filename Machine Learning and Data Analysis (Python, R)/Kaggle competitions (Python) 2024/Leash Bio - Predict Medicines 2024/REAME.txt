This is my first project with "large" data.
Molecule Fingerprints are generated for predicting binding affinity of molecules to three different proteines.

It was interesting to learn about Tensorflow.Datasets and TFRrecord-Files to handle data streams.
It's a pity that the available disc space on Kaggle does not suffice to hold the full preprocessed data, even in a TFRecords-File.

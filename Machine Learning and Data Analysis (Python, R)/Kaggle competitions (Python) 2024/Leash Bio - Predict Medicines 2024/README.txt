Molecule Fingerprints are generated for predicting binding affinity of molecules to three different proteines.

Two approaches can be found:
- In "alternative approach....ipynb", where only the building blocks are taken as predictors, without considering their chemical structure.
- In main.ipynb, fingerprints are generated. This should pose the best basis for good generalization.

Up until now, the alternative approach works best.
It would be important to do some grid-searches to improve the models.
